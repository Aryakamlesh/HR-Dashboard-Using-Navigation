HR Dashboard using Navigation

Introduction/Purpose -- 
The dashboard uses a summary navigation to provide clear navigation paths to more detailed reports or different sections. This design pattern improves usability by preventing users from having to scroll through extensive information to get a high-level overview or find specific details. An HR dashboard that uses a navigation summary typically refers to a design structure where a main executive overview page includes high-level Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), each acting as an interactive button or link to a more detailed, specific dashboard. This allows users to get a quick summary. The design makes complex data accessible and easy to navigate for various stakeholders, from HR managers to C-suite executives. It elevates HR from a support function to a strategic partner by linking HR data directly to business performance indicators.
